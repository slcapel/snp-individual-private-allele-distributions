# Individual Private Allele Genotypes for Population of Interest

This script was designed to identify the distribution of private alleles among individuals of a population of interest following identification of private alleles among populatios of origin (see https://github.com/slcapel/snp-population-level-private-allele-tracker). While it is informative to identify the population-level distribution of private alleles present via maintenance and introgression, it can be equally important to understand how those private alleles are distributed among individuals of said population.

This script cannot be executed properly without first identifying population-level private allele using https://github.com/slcapel/snp-population-level-private-allele-tracker. The final product of this script is a modified VCF file containing all individuals from the population of interest and their genotypes for each private allele locus.

## Requirements:
* Linux-based environment with bash-5.0 or later
* VCFtools v0.1.16 or later
* Private Allele Tracker v1.0.0 (https://github.com/slcapel/snp-population-level-private-allele-tracker) output files

## Instructions
**After running `population_private_alleles.sh`**, simply fill out the following variables within the "INPUTS" box near the top of the script:
* Within the quotations following `popint` input the string used to designate your population of interest in your population map used by the _populations_ program of Stacks (Rochette et al. 2019)
* Following `src1` input the path to directory containing populations run for all populations
* Following `src2` input the path to directory containing populations run for populations of origin
* Following `popmap` input the path to the population map file used to run _populations_ for all populations

Once you have filled out the required inputs simply run the script on the command line `./individual_private_allele_distributions.sh`.  There will be no text output on the command line as the script is running, rather results will appeard as two final output files.  All intermediate/temporary files are deleted at the end of the script.  If you wish to keep any of these simply delete the corresponding `rm` command(s).

## Output files & format
(1) `$popint.Indiv.PA.GT.tsv`: individual private allele genotypes
** This file contains the genotypes of all individuals within the population of interest for asll private allele loci along with corresponding metadata
** As with standard VCF files, diploid genotypes are coded as 0 for the major/most common allele and 1 for the minor allele - in this case the private allele
** $popint will be the string designation for the population of interest

| Column | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Locus ID_Col | Private allele locus and SNP ID as assigned by populations.sumstats.tsv (i.e. Locus_SNP) |
| 2 | Pop ID | Population from which the private allele originated |
| 3 | Q Nuc | Private allele nucleotide identity |
| 4 | CHROM | Locus ID as assigned by the VCF file (off by 1 when compared to other Stacks files) |
| 5 | POS | SNP ID as assigned by the VCF file (off by 1 when compared to other Stacks files) |
| 6+ | _varies_ | The genotypes of each individual from the population of interest for each private allele locus |

(2) `$popint.Indiv.PA.distribs.tsv`: individual distributions of private alleles from populations of origin
** This file contains the number of private alleles from each population of origin for each individual within the population of interest
** Individuals heterozygous for a private allele (i.e. 0/1) are considered to have 1 private allele at the given locus while thoes homozygous for a private allele (i.e. 1/1) are considered to have 2
** The sum of private alleles from each population of origin is calulated by adding across all loci for each individual
** $popint will be the string designation for the population of interest
| Column | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | P.A. Origin | Population from which private alleles originated |
| 2+ | _varies_ | The total number of private alleles each individual possesses from each population of origin |
