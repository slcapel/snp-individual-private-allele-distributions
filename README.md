# Individual Private Allele Genotypes for Population of Interest

This script was designed to identify the distribution of private alleles among individuals of a population of interest following identification of private alleles among populatios of origin (see https://github.com/slcapel/snp-population-level-private-allele-tracker). While it is informative to identify the population-level distribution of private alleles present via maintenance and introgression, it can be equally important to understand how those private alleles are distributed among individuals of said population.

This script cannot be executed properly without first identifying population-level private allele using https://github.com/slcapel/snp-population-level-private-allele-tracker. The final product of this script is a modified vcf file containing all individuals from the population of interest and their genotypes for each private allele locus.

## Requirements:
* Linux-based environment with bash-5.0 or later
* VCFtools v0.1.16 or later
* Private Allele Tracker v1.0.0 (https://github.com/slcapel/snp-population-level-private-allele-tracker) output files

## Output file format
| Column | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Locus ID_Col | Private allele locus and SNP ID as assigned by populations.sumstats.tsv (i.e. Locus_SNP) |
| 2 | Pop ID | Population from which the private allele originated |
| 3 | Q Nuc | Private allele nucleotide identity |
| 4 | CHROM | Locus ID as assigned by the VCF file (off by 1 when compared to other Stacks files) |
| 5 | POS | SNP ID as assigned by the VCF file (off by 1 when compared to other Stacks files) |
| 6+ | [will vary] | Remaining columns are the genotypes of each individual from the population of interest for each locus |
